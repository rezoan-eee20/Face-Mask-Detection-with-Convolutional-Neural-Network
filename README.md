# Face-Mask-Detection-with-Python-and-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Face Mask Detection with Python, OpenCV and Tensorflow/Keras using Convolutional Neural Network
Applied Cascade classifier to get the region of interest (ROI) of the face from the webcam; resized the ROI into 100×100 pixel image and then pass it to my trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to get the output probability of face with mask and without mask; preprocessed the image by OpenCV; used 2 CNN layer model, 1st and 2nd layer consists of 3×3 200 and 100 kernels respectively, applied RELU layer and pooling layer for both of the layers; introduced flatten layer and included dropout layer to avoid over fitting, finally connected with a dense layer of 50 neurons and the output layer(dense layer) has 2 neurons; used dataset of 1376 images with mask 690 images and without mask 686 images; achieved 96% accuracy.
